    Given the financials of {company}:
    Revenue: {revenue}
    Net Income: {income}
    EPS: {eps}
    
    Write a short analysis on the company's financial performance. Avoid made-up numbers.
    For example, 
    Given the financials of Apple Inc.:
    Revenue: $394.33B  
    Net Income: $99.80B  
    EPS: $6.11  
     
    Expected respose format: Apple Inc. has demonstrated strong financial performance. With a revenue of $394.33 billion and a net income of $99.80 billion, the company maintains a high profit margin, indicating effective cost management. An EPS of $6.11 reflects solid earnings per share, signaling good value generation for investors. These figures point to Appleâ€™s continued dominance and financial stability in the tech sector.

    For example, 
    Given the financials of Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.:
    Revenue: $5.18B  
    Net Income: -$1.12B  
    EPS: -$13.44
     
    Expected Response format: Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. is facing significant financial difficulties. The company reported a revenue of $5.18 billion but a net loss of $1.12 billion, indicating severe profitability issues. The negative EPS of -$13.44 reflects substantial losses per share, raising concerns for investors. These figures suggest poor cost control and declining performance, potentially impacting long-term sustainability
